## Custom Console Package

The `CustomConsole` npm package provides a flexible logging utility tailored for JavaScript applications. While mirroring the behavior of a standard console during development, it intelligently routes error messages to a designated endpoint in production environments, facilitating streamlined error tracking and management.

### Features

- Seamless transition between development and production logging.
- Direct error logging to a specified server endpoint in production.
- Simplified setup and integration.

### Installation

You can install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install custom-console-package
```

### Usage

Initialize the `CustomConsole` class with your desired error logging endpoint:

```javascript
const CustomConsole = require("custom-console-package");

const customConsole = new CustomConsole("https://my-server.com/error-endpoint");

customConsole.log("This is a log message.");
customConsole.error("This is an error message.");
```

### Parameters

- **errorEndpoint**: The URL endpoint where error messages will be sent during production.
